#### What:
Web toy to superimpose the faculty photos from dept of CS at AC with own portrait.


#### More on that please?
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Allegheny College transitioned to online-only instruction. Sadly, the graduating seniors would not be able to have a photo of themselves standing next to their professors at the end of this semester. However, thanks to some free time and a spark of excitement, our seniors are now able to have their photos taken next to their professors. Run the myIndex.html in a server environment to view your image next to those of your professors. Say cheese and capture with a screenshot. Congratulations!

#### Get Started

  1. From the directory where you have ```myIndex.html```,
  run ```python3 -m http.server``` and then point your browser to: ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```

  2. Run myIndex.html in a local server.

  3. Turn on your laptop's video camera.

  4. Say cheese, congratulations to you, and smile.

  5. Go get 'em
